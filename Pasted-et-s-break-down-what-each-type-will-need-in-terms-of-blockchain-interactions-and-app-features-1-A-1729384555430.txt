et’s break down what each type will need in terms of blockchain interactions and app features:

1. Artists
Role: Mint NFTs, manage their own artwork, and interact with attendees.
Blockchain Interaction:
Minting NFTs: Artists use their own wallet to mint NFTs representing their artwork.
Access Control: Artists might have special permissions for editing artwork details or interacting with event-specific smart contracts.
Access Features:
Uploading artwork details, minting tokens, viewing artwork ownership history, interacting with attendees.
2. Attendees
Role: Engage with the event, interact with artworks, collect NFTs, and access exclusive content.
Blockchain Interaction:
Wallet Verification: Use their own wallet to log in and sign messages to authenticate.
Minting or Buying NFTs: Can purchase NFTs created by artists.
Exclusive Content: Using NFTs as access keys to unlock exclusive content.
Access Features:
Viewing artwork, minting their NFTs, accessing exclusive content if they hold the corresponding NFT.
3. Admins
Role: Manage the event, oversee activities, and make sure things run smoothly.
Blockchain Interaction:
No Direct Private Key Use: Ideally, admins wouldn’t need direct blockchain transactions (e.g., minting tokens), but would instead oversee the system.
They might, however, need elevated permissions to view blockchain data (like total minted NFTs, transaction history, etc.) using read-only access.
Access Features:
Managing artist accounts, event settings, and overseeing transactions. Admins can access dashboards with real-time analytics provided by services like The Graph.
How to Structure the Application:
Authentication:
Artists and Attendees authenticate through wallets like MetaMask.
Admins could have a more traditional username/password login but also connect via a wallet if they’re performing blockchain-specific roles.
Blockchain Interaction Points:
Attendees and Artists use wallets for all blockchain actions (minting, transfers).
Admins oversee operations without needing private keys, unless deploying new contracts.
Blockchain and Wallet Tools:
Sign Protocol (for SIWE): This will work well for all three types of users to authenticate.
Wallet-Based Features:
Artists: Enable minting contracts through a UI that interacts with SKALE via MetaMask.
Attendees: Enable access to content and purchases via NFTs.
Admins: Oversee content, but without needing direct write access to blockchain.
